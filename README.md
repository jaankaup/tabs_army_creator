# Totally accurate battle simulator army creation tool.

This is an Rust application that is compiled to wasm. This is also my first Rust project (beware the awfull code with lots of unsafe blocks).
The web page can be used to generate TABS (totally accurate battle simulator) armies.
The actual tabs unit symbols are not included because they are must likely copyright material.
